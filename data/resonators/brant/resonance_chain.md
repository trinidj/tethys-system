# Brant Resonance Chain

## Sequence Node 1: By Currents and Winds

Returned from Ashes temporarily causes nearby targets to stagnate while casting. The stagnation effect is removed when Brant is switched off the field.

After casting Intro Skill Applaud for Me! or each flip following Mid-air Attack, Brant's DMG dealt is increased by 20% for 5s, stacking up to 3 times.

## Sequence Node 2: For Smiles and Cheers

Casting Mid-air Attack and Returned from Ashes increases Brant's Crit. Rate by 30%. Brant's Outro Skill The Course is Set! gains a new enhancement:

- When Resonance Skill cast by the incoming Resonator (or nearby Resonators who activate Brant's Outro Skill) hits a target within 20s after Brant's Outro Skill, Brant blasts the hit target, dealing Fusion DMG equal to 440% of Brant's ATK (considered Basic Attack DMG). This explosion can be triggered 1 time per second, up to 2 explosions in total.

- This effect remains active when Brant is switched off the field.

## Sequence Node 3: Through Storms I Sail

The DMG Multiplier of Returned from Ashes is increased by 42%.

## Sequence Node 4: To Freedom I Sing

The Shield obtained from Returned from Ashes is increased by 20%. Casting Returned from Ashes restores HP for all nearby Resonators in the team (6.60 HP for every 1% Energy Regen).

## Sequence Node 5: All the World's an Actor's Stage

Dealing Basic Attack DMG gives Brant 15% Basic Attack DMG Bonus for 10s.

## Sequence Node 6: All the World's a Captain's Carnevale

Mid-air Attack's DMG Multiplier is increased by 30%. Casting Returned from Ashes causes a secondary blast, dealing Fusion DMG equal to 30% of the DMG dealt by Returned from Ashes, considered Basic Attack DMG.
